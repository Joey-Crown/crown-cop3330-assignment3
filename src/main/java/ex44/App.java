/* Exercise 44 - Product Search
Pulling data from a file into a complex data structure makes parsing much simpler. Many programming languages support
the JSON format, a popular way of representing data.

Create a program that takes a product name as input and retrieves the current price and quantity for that product. The
product data is in a data file in the JSON format  and looks like this (you will create this file as `exercise44_input.json`):

{
    "products" : [
        {"name": "Widget", "price": 25.00, "quantity": 5 },
        {"name": "Thing", "price": 15.00, "quantity": 5 },
        {"name": "Doodad", "price": 5.00, "quantity": 10 }
    ]
}
Print out the product name, price, and quantity if the product is found. If no product matches the search, state that
no product was found and start over.

Example Output

What is the product name? iPad
Sorry, that product was not found in our inventory.
What is the product name? Galaxy
Sorry, that product was not found in our inventory.
What is the product name? Thing
Name: Thing
Price: 15.00
Quantity: 5

Constraints

The file is in the JSON format. Use a JSON parser to pull the values out of the file
(e.g. https://github.com/google/gson).
If no record is found, prompt again.

Challenges

Ensure that the product search is case insensitive.
When a product is not found, ask if the product should be added. If yes, ask for the price and the quantity, and save
it in the JSON file. Ensure the newly added product is immediately available for searching without restarting the program.
